# Credit Risk Analysis – End-to-End Financial Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Summary
This project is a comprehensive **Credit Risk Analysis** built using **Excel, Power BI, and Python (Pandas)**.  
It simulates a real-world banking analytics workflow where customer loan data is analyzed to assess **portfolio health, repayment behavior, and default risk**.

The project focuses on **data-driven decision-making**, combining dashboarding and exploratory data analysis to extract actionable business insights commonly required in **banking, fintech, and consulting roles**.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Banks and financial institutions face constant challenges in:
- Assessing loan default risk
- Monitoring repayment performance
- Understanding customer risk segments
- Making informed credit decisions

This project answers key business questions such as:
- What proportion of loans are fully paid vs charged off?
- Which customer attributes influence loan repayment?
- How does income, employment, and credit behavior relate to default risk?
- How can dashboards and EDA support credit risk monitoring?

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer-level loan records with features such as:
- Loan Amount
- Annual Income
- Employment Length
- Credit Score
- Loan Status (Fully Paid / Charged Off)

Both **training and testing datasets** were used to ensure realistic analysis and validation.
